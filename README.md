So yet another solidity - hardhat practice project. This is the ToDo app that i made with Hardhat-ReactJS. You need to be the owner of the contract in order to use it, so in that case only i can use it lol xD

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
